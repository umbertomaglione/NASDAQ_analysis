# Analyzing 30 years of NASDAQ

In the following project we
+ explored the characteristics of financial returns
+ manually built a regression-based estimator for the tail-index, the Hill estimator and CUSUM
+ compared different GARCH variants and selected the proper amount of lags
+ ran a mispecification
+ discussed the benefits of a fixed-volatility bootstrap, and how to circumvent the inconsistency due to parameters on the boundary
